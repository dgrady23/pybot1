# pybot1
This bot has a regular hello command, and a !poll command that take 2 arguments, event_name and event_date, and combines them into one sentence that pings everybody.
The main sources i used to develop this bot is a tutorial on freecodecamp that i used to become famimiar with python, then another tutorial to learn ctx. I then changed to code to not need an admin channel, and changed how the send message command runs to make it much more efficient and easier to use.
