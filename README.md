# pybot1

This is my discord bot i made in python

This bot has a regular hello command, and a !poll command that take 2 arguments, event_name and event_date, and combines them into one sentence that pings everybody.
The main sources i used to develop this bot is a tutorial on freecodecamp(https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/create-a-discord-bot-with-python/) that i used to become famimiar with python, then another tutorial to learn ctx(https://cylab.be/blog/217/create-deploy-a-discord-bot-part-23-bot-features). I then changed to code to not need an admin channel, and changed how the send message command runs to make it much more efficient and easier to use.
